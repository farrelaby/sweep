## Supported targets

| Directory | Language / Framework |
|-----------|-------------------|
| `node_modules` | Node.js |
| `target` | Rust, Maven (Java) |
| `.next` | Next.js |
| `__pycache__` | Python |
| `.venv` / `venv` | Python virtual environments |
| `dist` / `build` | JS/TS bundlers, Gradle (Java/Kotlin) |
| `vendor` | Go, PHP (Composer) |
| `Pods` | iOS (CocoaPods) |
| `bower_components` | Legacy JavaScript |
| `.tox` | Python (tox) |
| `out` | Kotlin/Java |

### Lock file detection

`dirsweep` detects the language/package manager by scanning for lock files and manifests in the parent directory:

| Lock file | Package manager |
|-----------|----------------|
| `package-lock.json` | npm |
| `pnpm-lock.yaml` | pnpm |
| `bun.lockb` | bun |
| `deno.lock` | deno |
| `yarn.lock` | yarn |
| `Cargo.lock` | Cargo (Rust) |
| `go.sum` | Go |
| `Gemfile.lock` | Bundler (Ruby) |
| `composer.lock` | Composer (PHP) |

### Monorepo detection

`dirsweep` identifies monorepo structures to help you understand what you're deleting:

| File | Monorepo tool |
|------|--------------|
| `pnpm-workspace.yaml` | pnpm workspaces |
| `turbo.json` | Turborepo |
| `nx.json` | Nx |
| `lerna.json` | Lerna |
| `workspaces` in `package.json` | npm/yarn workspaces |
| `Cargo.toml` with `members` | Rust workspace |

Root-level `node_modules` in monorepos are highlighted as they may be shared across packages — deleting them could break the entire workspace.
