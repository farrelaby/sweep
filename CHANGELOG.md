## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-01

### Added
- Language-based project detection with 7 ecosystems (rust, js, python, go, ruby, php, cocoapods)
- Detection via lock files AND config files (pyproject.toml, go.mod, Gemfile, composer.json, etc.)
- Recursive target dir scanning within project subtrees (`__pycache__`, `.venv`, `.tox`)
- Project headers display detected languages (e.g. `my-app (js, rust)`)

### Changed
- Replaced flat `KNOWN_TARGETS` list with per-language `root_target_dirs` and `deep_target_dirs`
- `vendor`, `Pods`, `node_modules` etc. only checked at project root (no false positives from source dirs)
- `build` removed from default target dirs (language-specific now)

### Removed
- Orphan target detection entirely (zero false positive guarantee)

### Added
- `dirsweep update` command for self-updating from GitHub releases
- `dirsweep uninstall` command for self-removing the binary
